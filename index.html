    <h2> Basic Information</h2>
    
	<p id= "basic-info" >Birds are <em>awesome</em> animals that are found<br>
    everywhere around the world in many different variations. <br>
    The main characteristic of a bird is feathers. <em><strong><br>
    No other animal has feathers.</strong></em> Other important <br>
    features for birds are wings and hollow bones. Birds also lay eggs,<br>
    like reptiles, however they are warm-blooded, like mammals. </p>
    
    <h2>Where they live</h2>
    
    <p>Birds live in diverse habitats: deserts, mountains,<br> 
    forests, tundras, near the bodies of water, etc. A lot<br>  
    of birds never leave their living places, the others<br> 
    migrate to warmer countries when the weather changes.<br> 
    Migrations may be tens of thousands of kilometers long.</p> 
    
    <h2 id="eating"> What they eat </h2>
     <p> It depends on the bird and the time of the year. Some eat<br> 
     seeds, berries, fruit, insects, other birds, eggs, small mammals,<br> 
     fish, buds, larvae, aquatic invertebrates, acorns and other nuts, a<br> 
     quatic vegetation, grain, dead animals, garbage, and much moreâ€¦</p>

I'll give you all I have<br>
And nothing less I promise <br>

Oh I promise you  </p>
